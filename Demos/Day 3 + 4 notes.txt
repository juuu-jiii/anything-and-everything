return new EmptyResult(); causes the browser to display a blank white screen. It represents
simply "no result". Note that a void action method return type is equivalent to EmptyResult()

(within controller - Model Binder is invoked, assuming param names match names of class fields)
public string SaveEmployee(Employee e, string firstName)
{
	return e.FirstName + "|" + e.LastName + "|" + e.Salary;
}

If model binder cannot be invoked i.e. param names do not match names of class fields, manually 
construct the Model object within the action method using Request.Form["componentName"]; 
public ActionResult SaveEmployee()
{
        Employee e = new Employee();
        e.FirstName = Request.Form["FName"];
        e.LastName = Request.Form["LName"];
        e.Salary = int.Parse(Request.Form["Salary"])
...
...
}

or by passing the names of the components (MUST match) as strings into the action method and using 
them to create the Model object
public ActionResult SaveEmployee(string FName, string LName, int Salary)
{
    Employee e = new Employee();
    e.FirstName = FName;
    e.LastName = LName;
    e.Salary = Salary;
...
...
}

[this is called a DataAnnotation/Attribute and is used for validation. Multiple can be used together,
like Authorize and HttpPost]
public string Name;
