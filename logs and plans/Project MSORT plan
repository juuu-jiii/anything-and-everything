PROJECT MSORT

A program that accepts a 14 tile mj hand, and returns relevant stats.

For now, a half-set w/o bonus tiles will be used. Tiles will be represented using the following notation:
- 1 - 9 = 1p - 9p
- E, S, W, N
- R, WH, G

How to use:
- When prompted, use the keyboard to input an mj hand that is at least 13 tiles long
- Press ENTER to submit the hand for checking.

Visuals:
- For now, just a regular console app will do. Graphics can come when the entire project is up and running

Goals, in order of priority:
1. Return all possible winning hands from the current input. If none can be formed, print "INVALID HAND"
2. Add the other two suits into the mix, and refactor the sort algorithm to allow for their usage
3. Add scoring, by including bonus tiles, flagging the final tile that completes the hand, and analysing
		each of the possible compbinations returned in goal 1.
		
Goal ONE - Return all possible winning hands from the current input. If none can be formed, print "INVALID HAND"
*	Begin with a sort algorithm.
